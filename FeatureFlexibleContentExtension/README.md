# Feature Flexible Content Extension

The difference to the Flynt [FeatureFlexibleContentExtension](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/Components/FeatureFlexibleContentExtension) is that this contains a Global Option to Opt-in to display a “Component Live Preview” next to the title of a component and on hover the preview will getting slightly bigger. Like the Flynt [FeatureFlexibleContentExtension](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/Components/FeatureFlexibleContentExtension) it also adds component search in the tooltip to easily find the component by name.

Notice: Opt-in to the “Component Live Preview” can maybe result in some performance issues due it is based on iFrames.
